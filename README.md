A lightweight, zero-runtime-dependency, high-performance localization system for Unity with support for multiple languages, RTL (Right-to-Left) text, binary format (BLOC), and DeepL/Gemini translation integration.

## Features

- **High Performance** - Binary BLOC format for fast loading and minimal memory footprint
- **100+ Languages** - Support for over 100 languages with native name display
- **RTL Support** - Automatic Right-to-Left text handling for Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, and more
- **Zero Runtime Dependencies** - Only requires TextMeshPro (optional for basic usage)
- **Anti-Tamper** - Optional file hash verification to protect translation files
- **Editor Tools** - Built-in Language Editor with DeepL/Gemini translation integration
- **Multiple Component Support** - Works with TMP_Text, TMP_Dropdown, Legacy UI, and TextMesh
- **Format Parameters** - String formatting support with `{0}`, `{1}` placeholders

## Localization App

I also developed a separate localization management app built with modern web technologies (**React + Vite + Tauri**) to make working with translations much easier than using the default Unity UI.
It provides a cleaner interface for managing, editing, and translating localization data, which significantly speeds up the workflow.
I highly recommend using this app when working with the localization system.

Repository: [Localization-UI](https://github.com/PicoShot/Localization-UI)

## Quick Start

### 1. Installation

Add the package via Unity Package Manager:

```
https://github.com/PicoShot/Localization-Unity.git?path=/Package
```

### 2. Create Language Files

Open the Language Editor from `Tools > Localization > Language Editor` to:

- Add supported languages
- Create translation keys
- Add translations for each language
- Click on save to export BLOC files to project

### 3. Add to Scene

Add the `Localized Text` component to any GameObject with a text component:

### Via Inspector

1. Add "Localized Text" component
2. Set Translation Key to your key

### 4. Access Translations in Code

```csharp
// Get a simple translation
string greeting = LocalizationManager.GetText("greeting");

// With format parameters
string welcome = LocalizationManager.GetText("welcome_message", "John");

// Get an array of strings
string[] options = LocalizationManager.GetArray("menu_options");
```
